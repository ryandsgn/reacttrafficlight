Here we have created a functional traffic light using React, javascript, HTML and CSS. We implement the use of hooks to control the state of the lights and several other elements.

To visualize the traffic light and its controls in your browser, please follow these intructions. We recommend using Gitpod as the quickest method to try the functionality.

$ cd traffic-light
$ npm install      (only the first time)
$ npm start

Here is a preview of the traffic light.
